##  Vaccine Distribution and Management System (VDMS)

A system engineering project designed to streamline and secure the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines for Pharma Company XYZ. Developed as part of the SE-627 Requirements Engineering and Management course, this project proposes a modular software architecture focused on regulatory compliance, real-time logistics tracking, and predictive analytics.

---

###  Project Objective
To design a logistics and distribution management system that ensures efficient, safe, and regulatory-compliant delivery of vaccines from manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and EU to global destinations.

---

###  Key Features
- **Automated MSO Generation:** Vaccine orders are processed within 5 minutes.
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Real-time sensor tracking of vaccine shipments.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast demand, optimize routes, and monitor supply-chain risks.
- **Emergency & Maintenance Modes:** Adaptive workflows for crises and system upkeep.
- **Financial Integration:** Automated invoice generation and financial postings.
- **Security & Audit Compliance:** End-to-end encryption, access control, and audit trails.

---

###  System Architecture
The VDMS system comprises four main modules:
- **VM (Vaccine Management)**
- **LS (Logistics & Shipment)**
- **FA (Financial & Accounting)**
- **AD (Analytics & Decision Support)**

Each module integrates with others for real-time data flow, operational alerts, and decision support, while maintaining regulatory standards such as **21 CFR 205.50** and **European Good Distribution Practices**.
